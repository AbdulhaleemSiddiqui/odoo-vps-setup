Hi 👋 I'm Abdul Haleem

I’m a professional Odoo ERP developer with hands-on experience in deploying, configuring, and managing Odoo 17 and Odoo 18 using Docker-based architectures. I focus on clean system design, version isolation, and production-ready ERP solutions for businesses.

🚀 Odoo Developer | Docker | ERP Solutions

I help businesses and clients by building stable, scalable, and secure Odoo environments, especially when multiple Odoo versions are required on a single VPS or server.

💼 What I Do

Odoo 17 & Odoo 18 Docker-based Deployments
I deploy different Odoo versions in isolated Docker containers to avoid conflicts in Python libraries, system packages, and databases.

🐳 Docker & PostgreSQL Isolation Expert
Each Odoo instance runs with its own PostgreSQL database container, ensuring data safety, clean separation, and easy maintenance.

🌍 VPS & Production-ready Setups
I configure Odoo on VPS servers (Ubuntu) with proper networking, ports, volumes, and security best practices.

🛠 Custom Odoo Modules & Migrations
I develop and manage custom Odoo addons and assist with version upgrades and database migrations.

📌 Key Projects & Experience

Odoo 17 & Odoo 18 Docker Setup
Complete Docker-Compose based setup with separate containers for Odoo and PostgreSQL, custom addons, and persistent volumes.

Multi-version Odoo Deployment on a Single VPS
Running multiple Odoo versions simultaneously (e.g., Odoo 17 on port 8069 and Odoo 18 on port 8070) without conflicts.
